# useMotionTransitions

useMotionTransitions is used to handle the multiple animations created when you animate your elements.

It exposes `push` and `stop` which are both functions.

## Exposed

### `push(key, value, target, transition)`

Push function run and add a transition to the current useMotionTransitions instance.

### `stop(keys | key | undefined)`

Stop is a function that lets you stop ongoing animations for a specific element.

Calling it without argument will be stopping all the animations.

Calling it with an array of [**Motion Properties**](/motion-properties) keys will stop every specified key.

Calling it with a single motion property key will stop the specified key.

## Example

```typescript
const target = ref<HTMLElement>()

const { motionProperties } = useMotionProperties(target)

motionProperties.x = 0

const { push, stop } = useMotionTransitions()

push('x', 100, motionProperties, { type: 'spring', bounce: 4 })

setTimeout(stop, 4000)
```
