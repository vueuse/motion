title: useMotionControls
description: Creates controls for motion properties and transitions.
---

useMotionControls is used to create motion controls from motion properties and motion transitions.

[Motion Instance](/features/motion-instance) members are **helpers** for you to interact with your element motion properties with ease.

## Parameters

### `motionProperties`

A [Motion Properties](/api/use-motion-properties) instance.

### `variants`

A [Variants](/features/variants#custom-variants) definition.

### `motionTransitions`

A [Motion Transitions](/api/use-motion-transitions) instance.

## Exposed

### `apply(variant)`

Apply function will take a [Variant Definition](/features/variants) and apply it to the element without changing the current variant value.

It also accepts a variant key from variants parameter, that will be applied without changing the current variant name.

Apply is a promise that will be resolved once all the transitions resulting from the variant you passed are done.

### `set(variant)`

Set function will take a [Variant Definition](/features/variants) and apply it to the element without changing the current variant value.

It also accepts a variant key from variants parameter, that will be applied without changing the current variant name.

It differs from `apply(variant)` as it will set values on target without running any transitions.

### `stopTransitions()`

Stop Transitions function will stop all ongoing transitions on the current [useMotionTransitions](/api/use-motion-transitions) instance.

## Example

```typescript
const target = ref<HTMLElement>()

const { motionProperties } = useMotionProperties(target)

const { apply, stopTransitions } = useMotionControls(motionProperties, {
  initial: {
    y: 100,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  custom: {
    y: 0,
    opacity: 1,
  },
})

apply({
  opacity: 1,
  scale: 2,
})

setTimeout(() => {
  stopTransitions()

  console.log('Stopped after 200ms!')
}, 200)

const applyCustom = async () => {
  await apply('custom')

  console.log('Custom applied!')
}
```
