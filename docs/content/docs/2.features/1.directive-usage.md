# Directive Usage

vueuse/motion allows you to write your animations right from the template of your components without having to wrap the target elements in any wrapper component.

The directive is expected to work the same whether you use it on a HTML or SVG element, or on any Vue component.

## Your first v-motion

v-motion is the name of the directive from this package.

The directive usage allows you to write your variants right from the template of your components.

The v-motion can be used as many times you want in any and on any HTML or SVG component.

Once put on an element, the v-motion will allow you to write your variants as props of this element.

The supported variants props are the following:

- **`initial`**: The properties the element will equip before it is mounted.
- **`enter`**: The properties the element will equip after it is mounted.
- **`visible`**: The properties the element will equip every time it is within view. Once it is out of view, the `initial` properties will be applied.
- **`visible-once`**: The properties the element will equip once it is within view.
- **`hovered`**: The properties the element will equip when the pointer enters its area.
- **`focused`**: The properties the element will equip when the element receives focus.
- **`tapped`**: The properties the element will equip upon clicking (mouse) or tapping (touch devices).

You can also pass your variants as an object using the `:variants` prop.

The `:variants` prop will be combined with all the other native variants properties, allowing you to define only your custom variants from this object.

The rest of the variants properties can be found on the [Variants](/docs/features/variants) page.

### Shorthand props

For convenience we support the following shorthand props which allow you to quickly configure transition properties:

- **`delay`**
- **`duration`**

If you specified a `visible`, `visible-once` or `enter` variant, these shorthand properties will be applied to each of them.

Otherwise, they will be applied on the `initial` [variant](/docs/features/variants) instead.

```vue
<template>
  <div
    v-motion
    :initial="{ opacity: 0, y: 100 }"
    :enter="{ opacity: 1, y: 0, scale: 1 }"
    :variants="{ custom: { scale: 2 } }"
    :hovered="{ scale: 1.2 }"
    :delay="200"
    :duration="1200"
  />
</template>
```

##### _Directives are amazing_ üòç

## Access a v-motion instance

When defined from template, the target element might not be assigned to a ref.

You can access motions controls using [useMotions](/docs/api/use-motions).

If you want to access a v-motion, you will have to give the element a name as v-motion value.

Then you can just call useMotions, and get access to that v-motion controls using its name as a key.

```vue
<template>
  <div
    v-motion="'custom'"
    :initial="{ opacity: 0, y: 100 }"
    :enter="{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }"
    :variants="{ custom: { scale: 2 } }"
  />
</template>

<script>
import { useMotions } from '@vueuse/motion'

// Get custom controls
const { custom } = useMotions()

const customEvent = () => {
  // Change the current variant of `custom` element
  custom.variant.value = 'custom'
}
</script>
```

In the above example, the custom object will be an instance of [Motion Instance](/docs/features/motion-instance).

### Custom Directives

You can add custom directives that will be prefixed by `v-motion` right from the plugin config.

```javascript
import { MotionPlugin } from '@vueuse/motion'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(MotionPlugin, {
  directives: {
    'pop-bottom': {
      initial: {
        scale: 0,
        opacity: 0,
        y: 100,
      },
      visible: {
        scale: 1,
        opacity: 1,
        y: 0,
      },
    },
  },
})

app.mount('#app')
```

With the code above, you will have access to `v-motion-pop-bottom` globally on any element or component of the app.
