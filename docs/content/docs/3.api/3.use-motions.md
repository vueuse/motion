# useMotions

useMotions is used to access the motion instances from v-motion directives declared from templates.

If you declare a name using `v-motion` attribute value, the motion instances will be added to the global useMotions state and be accessible from any component.

Be careful about duplicating the same name, note that the name can be including a variable.

## Exposed

### `{ ...motionControls }`

useMotions exposes an object in which keys are defined from all the **v-motion** for which you defined a name value.

Each values are [Motion Instances](/docs/features/motion-instance) for the named elements.

## Example

```vue
<template>
  <div v-motion="'myName'">
</template>

<script setup>
import { useMotions } from '@vueuse/motion'

const { myName } = useMotions()
</script>
```
