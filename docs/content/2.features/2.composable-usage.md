vueuse/motion is written using Composition API.

The composable usage of this package allows you to create animations from the `setup` hook of your components.

## Your first useMotion

useMotion is the core composable of this package.

It is a function that takes three parameters.

The first parameter is the `target`.

The target can be HTML or SVG elements, or references to these types.

The second parameter are the `variants`.

The [Variants Definitions](/features/variants) are described in a specific page.

```vue
<script setup>
import { useMotion } from '@vueuse/motion'

const target = ref<HTMLElement>()

const motionInstance = useMotion(target, {
  initial: {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 100
  },
  enter: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0
  }
})
</script>
```

Once called, the useMotion composable will return an instance of [Motion Instance](/features/motion-instance).

By using this motion instance members, you will be able to animate the element with ease.
