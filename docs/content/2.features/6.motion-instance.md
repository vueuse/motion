# Motion Instance

Motion instance is the object exposed when binding to a target element using [v-motion](/features/directive-usage) or [useMotion](/features/composable-usage).

It is composed of three properties, allowing you to interact with the element.

## Variant

The variant is a string reference, that you can modify and watch.

It represents the current variant name of the element.

By modifying this variant, you will trigger a transition between the current variant and the one you just set.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// Define target.
const target = ref<HTMLElement>()

// Get the variant from target motion instance.
const { variant } = useMotion(target, {
  initial: {
    scale: 1,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  enter: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      // This will go to `custom` when enter is complete.
      onComplete: () => (variant.value = 'custom'),
    },
  },
  custom: {
    scale: 2,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 100,
    },
  },
})
</script>
```

##### _Call customEvent to enable the custom variant_ ☝️

## Apply

Apply is a function that lets you animate to a variant definition, without changing the current variant.

This is useful when used with event listeners, or any temporary modification to the motion properties of the element.

This is also useful for orchestration, as apply returns a promise, you can await it and chain variant applying.

Apply accepts both a [Variant Declaration](/features/variants) or a key from the motion instance variants.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// Define target.
const target = ref<HTMLElement>()

// Get the variant from target motion instance.
const { apply } = useMotion(target, {
  initial: {
    scale: 1,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  enter: {
    opacity: 1,
    scale: 1,
  },
})

const customEvent = async () => {
  // Animate to a temporary variant.
  await apply({
    scale: 2,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 100,
    },
  })

  // Revert back to enter state
  await apply('enter')
}
</script>
```

##### _Call customEvent to Zboing the element_ ☝️

## Stop

Stop is a function that lets you stop ongoing animations for a specific element.

Calling it without argument will be stopping all the animations.

Calling it with an array of [Motion Properties](/features/motion-properties) keys will stop every specified key.

Calling it with a single motion property key will stop the specified key.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// Define target.
const target = ref<HTMLElement>()

// Get the variant from target motion instance.
const { stop } = useMotion(target, {
  initial: {
    scale: 1,
    opacity: 0,
  },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
  },
})

const customEvent = () => {
  // Stop the current animations.
  stop()
}
</script>
```
