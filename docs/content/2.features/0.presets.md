It allows you to start implementing animations straight after installing the plugin in your Vue app.

You can add your own presets to your app using [Custom Directives](/features/directive-usage#custom-directives).

If you have any ideas for new presets add an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/vueuse/motion#issues), or reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yaeeelglx).
