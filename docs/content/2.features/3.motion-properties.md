# Motion Properties

Motion properties are represented by an object containing all the animatable properties of an element.

They are one of the two parts that compose a [Variant](/features/variants), with [Transitions Declaration](/features/transition-properties).

This object contains both style and transform properties.

Note that when interacting with both style and transform properties, you are not forced to specify units and can instead just use numbers.

The default unit of the vast majority of attributes will be resolved and appended to the value dynamically.

```javascript
{
  opacity: 0,
  scale: 0.6,
  y: 100
}
```

## Style Properties

Style properties are used to decompose a regular `style` CSS string into individual object keys.

The typings are the same as the regular `style` property from Vue templates.

All the regular [CSS Style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/CSS/Reference) properties are supported.

Some keys are **forbidden** (`transition`, `rotate`, `scale`...) as they are now reserved for [Transform Properties](#transform-properties).

```javascript
{
  opacity: 0,
  marginTop: 10
}
```

## Transform Properties

Transform properties are used to decompose a regular `transform` CSS string into individual object keys.

All the regular [CSS Transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/CSS/transform#syntax) syntax arguments are supported.

As an addition, you can use `x`, `y`, `z` properties, that will be converted into `translateX`, `translateY` and `translateZ`.

```javascript
{
  x: 10,
  y: 20,
  scale: 1.2
}
```
