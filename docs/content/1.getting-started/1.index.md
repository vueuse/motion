## Plugin Installation

If you are planning on using the directives (`v-motion`) from this package, you might want to add the plugin to your Vue instance.

### Global Installation

You can add the support for `v-motion` globally, by installing the plugin.

```javascript
import { MotionPlugin } from '@vueuse/motion'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(MotionPlugin)

app.mount('#app')
```

### Component Installation

If you want to import the directive code only from components that uses it, import the directive and install it at component level.

```javascript
import { directive as motion } from '@vueuse/motion'

export default {
  directives: {
    motion: motion(),
  },
}
```
