# Presets

Presets are a set of animations that are bundled with the package.

It allows you to start implementing animations straight after installing the plugin in your Vue app.

You can add your own presets to your app using [**Custom Directives**](/directive-usage#custom-directives).

If you have any ideas for new presets add an issue on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/vueuse/motion#issues), or reach me on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/yaeeelglx).
