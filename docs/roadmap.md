# Roadmap

This package is under **active development**, as it still **misses** some **features**.

As I think it is still more than **usable** in its current **state**, I'm **releasing** it.

- ✔ : Done
- 👨‍💻 : WIP
- ❓ : Ideas

The **roadmap** includes:

- ✔ **Finishing documenting the whole API**
- ✔ **Per property transition definition**
- ✔ **Better orchestration features**
- ✔️ **Make the binding with Vue transition component easier**
- ✔ **More default variants**
- 👨‍💻 **Finish writing the test suite for each composable**
- 👨‍💻 **Context-aware elements, to enable animations between children**
- ❓ **vueuse/layout**
- ❓ **vueuse/gestures**
- ❓ **Making a playground to create animations with ease**
